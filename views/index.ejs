    <p class="catchcopy__text">
      The Pomodoro Technique is created by Francesco Cirillo for a
      more productive way to work and study. The technique uses a
      timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25
      minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval
      is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato',
      after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a
      university student. -
